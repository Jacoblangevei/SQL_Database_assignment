# iToons

iToons is a C# application which connects to a local SQL server with a database called Customer. The purpose of this app is to display, add, delete, update etc. the database's record by implementing and using the SQLClient.

## Installation

To use the app simply clone the repository, and open it with a C# operating IDE (we used Visual Studio). Since the app connects to a local server made in Microsoft Server Management Studio, the user also needs to make a local Customer database and change the connection strings.
